								<h3>History</h3>
									<p>The first debating societies at Berkeley were established in 1898.
										Separated by class, the Freshman Debating Society and the Sophomore Debating Society each met every other Wednesday to practice extemporaneous speaking in California Hall.
										They also hosted an annual interclass debate between themselves.</p>
									<p>
									Today, debating groups on campus are separated by format.
									Our organization, the Debate Society of Berkeley, competes in British Parliamentary (BP) debate as the original societies did.
									This format is practiced internationally, and our crowning tournament is the Worlds Universities Debating Championship.</p>
									<p>
									There are two other groups on campus dedicated to debating.
									Cal Debate competes in the policy format as regulated by the American Forensics Association.
									Their championship is known as the National Debate Tournament.
									Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley competes under the National Parliamentary Debate Association up to the NPDA Championship Tournament.</p>
									<p>
									We are proud to continue the tradition of BP debate not only on campus, but around the world.
									Our teams have competed in the last three world championships in the Netherlands, Mexico, and South Africa; our executive members have taught in China, Korea, and Vietnam.
									At home, we coach and judge for local high schools, support Bay Area BP tournaments, and organize two competitions of our own.</p>

									<p>Whether you are interested in debating near or far, we hope our club can support you!</p>

								<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
								<p><strong>Q: Do I need debate experience to join the club?</strong></p>
									<p>No. Some of our most successful members had never participated in organized debate prior to
										joining the club. But, be ready to practice diligently so you can catch up.
									</p>
								<p><strong>Q: What is the time commitment?</strong></p>
								<p>
									Practices will be three hours a minimum of twice per month, and general meetings will be 
									two hours once per week. We also expect four days of volunteering for the team per semester
									(helping us host tournaments, judging in the community, running workshops for members, etc.)
									which will be about 8 hours per day of volunteering. On an average week, we expect
									about 5 hours of commitment with a high degree of flexibility week to week.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Q: How can I prepare for the interview?</strong></p>
								<p>
									Reflect and relax. We are interested in hearing about what drew you to our organization, how you
									reason through arguments, and any previous experiences you’ve had with debate. Consider how to describe
									these things quickly and clearly.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Q: What should I wear to the interview?</strong></p>
								<p>Whatever you like.</p>
								<p><strong>Q: Do I need to bring anything to the interview?</strong></p>
								<p>Just yourself!</p>
<!--								<p><strong>What if I have prior debate experience in high school, but would like to take the Decal anyway?</strong></p>
								<p> Anybody who wishes to take the Decal may do so, but it is only required for members without previous experience.</p>-->
								<p><strong>How much do tournaments cost?</strong></p>
								<p> For active members, the Debate Society of Berkeley covers registration fees and
									offers subsidies for tournaments. Larger subsidies are offered for out of state
									tournaments due to additional costs for transportation. Subsidies may be offered on
									a competitive basis if the demand for a tournament is high.
